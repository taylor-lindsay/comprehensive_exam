# 4.4 CSIA

#### What is the difference between CSIA & SIA and how does CSIA work?&#x20;

Compound specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) elevates traditional bulk stable isotope analysis (SIA) by analyzing isotope ratios of multiple compounds.&#x20;

Bulk SIA&#x20;

1. Entire sample is homogenized & freeze dried
2. Tin capsules containing the sample are fed into an elemental analyzer&#x20;
   1. Samples are combusted&#x20;
   2. Gas Chromatography separates heavier from lighter elements&#x20;
3. The flow of gasses is fed into the mass spectrometer where they are pushed around a large magnet, separating&#x20;
4. Results show peaks for each element&#x20;

CSIA

1. Initial processing (lipid extraction)&#x20;
2. Samples are homogenized & freeze dried & fed into gas chromatograph combustion.&#x20;
3. Gas Chromatography separates compounds&#x20;
4. Combustion breaks down compounds&#x20;
5. The flow of gasses is fed into the mass spectrometer where they are pushed around a large magnet, separating&#x20;
6. Results show peaks for each compound
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each element&#x20;

#### Why use CSIA on corals

* As mixotrophs, it is difficult to disentangle the energetic inputs&#x20;
