# Environmental O & H

Mechanisms of O and H fractionation

The water cycle

* Pools: groundwater, soil, ocean, biomass, atmosphere/air, clouds
* Fluxes: evaporation/condensation, transpiration, root uptake, precipitation, advection, sublimation, percolation, infiltration

**Temperature Effect:** Precipitation isotope delta values decrease as temperature increases <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-05-12 at 8.34.52 AM.png" alt="" data-size="line">

* Salinity is a good predictor of O values in the ocean because evaporation and circulation drive both&#x20;

**Continental effect / distance from source:** precipitation isotope delta values decrease with distance from source (the ocean)&#x20;

**Latitudinal / Altitude effect:** precipitation isotope delta values decrease with increasing latitude or altitude <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-05-12 at 8.40.49 AM.png" alt="" data-size="line">

**Amount Effect:** Precipitation isotope delta values decrease with increasing raingall because they rain out. Generally follos Rayleigh model&#x20;

Isoscape Uses:&#x20;

* Tracing movement (sea or land)&#x20;
* Archives of past climate / paleo-climate
* Tracing origins of water&#x20;
* Trace water-rock reactions (like hydrothermal vents)&#x20;
