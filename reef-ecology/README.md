# Reef Ecology

You should also know the types of reefs, the different kinds of symbiosis on coral reefs, and the main ecological processes and players in those processes structuring communities on reefs. For instance, herbivory plays a significant role on reefs, and both corals and macroalgae are affected by fish and non-fish herbivores. What happens if you do not have them and on top of having climate change? Is climate change way worse than having a diminished number of herbivores?&#x20;
