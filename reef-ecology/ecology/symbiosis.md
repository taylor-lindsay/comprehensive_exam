# Symbiosis

## Types of symbiosis on reefs&#x20;

*

## Symbiodiniacea

* unicellular algae that photosynthesize&#x20;
* Pigmentation&#x20;
  * Chlorophyl a&#x20;
  * Chlorophyl c2
* Mutualistic relationship where both benefit
  * corals provide stable protected environment and an abundance of nutrients (CO2, N and P waste from cell resp in coral)
  * symbionts provide photosynthetic products (O2, energy rich organic macromolecules)&#x20;
  * Symbionts produce 10-100 times more C than they need and almost all this excess is transported to the coral&#x20;
* Obligate symbiosis - organisms like octocorals have lost the ability to heterotrophically feed, meaning they rely entirely on symbiosis&#x20;
* Facultative symbiosis - corals can survive with or without symbiosis, and can expel or gather symbionts according to energetic needs&#x20;

### Species/ taxonomy
