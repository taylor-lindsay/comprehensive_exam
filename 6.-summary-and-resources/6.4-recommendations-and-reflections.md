# 6.4 Recommendations & Reflections

1. Reference old exams - if you can get your hands on full exams or just questions from your committee members, it really helps demystify the types of questions you will be asked and the level of detail expected of you
2. Communication is key - having repeated meetings wit your committee members will be extremely helpful. I recommend going beyond just asking them for study materials or types of questions, but actually having conversations about the material with them will help you understand the level of detail they expect you to know. I also highly recommend meeting with your chair and discussing what you would like them to do during your orals.&#x20;
3. Studying is not just about memorization - preparing for your comps is not just about studying to memorize things. You need to organize and collect your resources so that you can quickly reference them, as well as improve&#x20;
