# 5.1 Science & Society

Iâ€™d like you to be able to respond to questions about science and how it works, at a level that would be appropriate in a conversation involving non-scientists.  As scientists, we should be ready to contribute a scientific perspective to topics that come up in everyday life. &#x20;



Why do scientists never answer questions with certainty? &#x20;

Is science different from religion? &#x20;

Is astrology a science? &#x20;

Is abortion murder?&#x20;

Are humans really causing the climate to change? &#x20;

Are GMO crops a hazard to human health? &#x20;

Should we vaccinate our children against diseases like polio and measles and diptheria?&#x20;

Should we have a six jaw of COVID-19?
