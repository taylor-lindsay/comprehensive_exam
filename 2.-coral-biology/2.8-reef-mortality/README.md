# 2.8 Reef Mortality

## Causes of Coral Decline&#x20;

* Climate Change - sea level rise, changes in storm frequency and intensity, changed ocean circulation & warming waters
* Sedimentation - sediments can smother coral colonies, clogging feeding structures, blocking sunlight, and causing exhaustion by forcing the animal to clean itself off (using mucus)&#x20;
  * caused by deforestation, coastal development, and agriculture&#x20;
* Excess nutrients - runoff from agriculture (fertilizers) and sewage, increasing N and P which peaks algal growth (phytoplankton blooms -> no oxygen, no light)&#x20;
* [Disease](https://floridadep.gov/sites/default/files/Coral-Bleaching-and-Disease-Fact-Sheet.pdf) - black band, white band, white plague etc.&#x20;
* Deoxygenation - 1-2% decrease in global dissolved oceanic oxygen. Deoxygenation negatively affects disease, bleaching, reproduction & growth rate.&#x20;

* Acidification - Increased CO2 in the atmosphere leads to increased DIC in the ocean, and the consumption of carbonate ions impedes calcification rates, making corals grow more slowly.&#x20;

* [Bioerosion](https://www.marine.usf.edu/reefslab/documents/evol\_ecol2007/Glynn\(inpress\).pdf) - any organism that erodes and weakens the calcareous skeletons of reefbuilding species.
  * external - parrot fish, puffer fish, hermit crab, limpet, urchin, chiton&#x20;
  * Internal - algae, fungi, bacteria, sponges, bivalves, barnacles, worms&#x20;
* Reef destruction - harmful fishing practices, development or other physical destruction of reefs&#x20;
* Algal competition / shifting states&#x20;
  * Decline in herbivores - fewer herbivores like urchins allows the shift to algal steady state&#x20;
  * Overfishing - removal of herbivorous teleosts enables macroalgal growth&#x20;
    * break down of food web
    * cyanide & dynamite fishing&#x20;
  * predators - crown of thorns sea star,&#x20;

## Effects of Bleaching &#x20;

* Summary
  * symbiont photosystem is easily overwhelmed by excess light leading to the production of reactive oxygen species&#x20;
  * create oxidative stress in the coral tissue, causing coral to expel symbionts to avoid tissue damage&#x20;
  * previous exposure & symbiont species affects bleaching severity&#x20;
* Slowed growth - &#x20;
* Mortality -&#x20;
* Reduced Reproduction -&#x20;
* Increased susceptibility to disease&#x20;





For instance, herbivory plays a significant role on reefs, and both corals and macroalgae are affected by fish and non-fish herbivores. What happens if you do not have them and on top of having climate change? Is climate change way worse than having a diminished number of herbivores?&#x20;
