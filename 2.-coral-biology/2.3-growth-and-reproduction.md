# 2.3 Growth & Reproduction

## Process of Reef Growth&#x20;

#### [Asexual budding](https://www.engineeringfordiscovery.org/how-do-corals-reproduce/)

* Growth is affected by light intensity, water motion, depth, turbidity, day length, water temp, plankton concentration, predation, competition&#x20;

#### Fragmentation&#x20;

* storms and waves can commonly break coral colonies, causing genetically identical copies of a colony&#x20;
* often contributes to single-species domination of an area&#x20;
* rapid recolonization after a disturbance&#x20;

#### [Polyp Bailout ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.7740)

#### Skeletal growth&#x20;

* growth rate determined by skeleton density&#x20;
* Average growth 1mm upward and 8mm horizontally per year (marine life book)
* depends on balance of deposition and removal of CaCO3&#x20;
  * contributions form calcareous algae, colonial hydrozoans, skeletons of crustaceans, bryozoans, foraminifera, mollusks, echinoderms.&#x20;
  * loss of CaCO3 can be caused by grazing/scraping urchins & fish, or etchers (bacteria, fungi, algae) that penetrate skeletons. Infaunal organisms (sponges, bivalves, worms) bore holes into skeletons.&#x20;

## Sexual Reproduction&#x20;

* strategy linked to taxonomy&#x20;
* Dioecious - only producing male or female gametes&#x20;
* hermaphroditic - possessing both male and female sex organs&#x20;

#### Brooders

* eggs remain in gastrovascular cavity where they are fertilized by motile sperm cells. developing zygotes are eventually released to settle nearby&#x20;
* commonly small-polyped species&#x20;

#### Spawners

* millions of gametes released into water column for external fertilization
* commonly large-polyped species&#x20;

#### Mass spawning events&#x20;

* induced by specific dark periods & the cycle of the moon&#x20;
* seasonality driven by temperatures&#x20;
* multi-speceis spawning may satiate predators by overwhelming them with food&#x20;

#### Larvae & recruitment&#x20;

* planula larvae - at first they swim towards brighter light (stay at surface where currents can facilitate dispersal), then after some development they swim away from light to settle on sea floor&#x20;
* Single-polyp recruits metamorphose into a juveline byt developing a CaCO3 skeleton, mouth and tentacles&#x20;
* Develop to maturity in 7-10 years&#x20;
