# 2.6 Mixotrophy & Energy

## Mixotrophy in Corals

* Mixotrophs - organisms that use multiple energetic strategies&#x20;
  * Dicot carnivores - plant autotrophs that also carnivorize animals
    * carnivorous plants,&#x20;
  * Anthozoan photosynthesizer - heterotrophic organism that integrates chloroplasts into its body&#x20;
    * nudibranchs, aphids&#x20;
  * Symbiotic mixotrophs - heterotrophs with endosymbionts that produce autotrophic energy&#x20;
    * Cnidarians, sponges, giant clams, salamanders &#x20;
  * Carnivorous Algae - photosynthesizing algae can consume microbes,&#x20;

A Mediterranean temperate coral was collected from nearby turbid and clear-water sites for SIA. Chl, protein, δ13C and symbiotic state did not change much based on site conditions, whereas δ15N did change a lot.  A more δ13C depleted in winter indicates higher reliance on heterotrophic C sources. C/N plots show that host and sym values are closer to the three food values in winter than in summer, indicating a different energy source in summer

Feeding and wound recovery study on the temperate coral A. poculata. The authors tracked wound recovery, growth rate, chl, PAM, and polyp behavior in apo- and symbiotic, fed and unfed colonies. Results were as expected with well fed, symbiotic colonies having the best wound recovery. However, some factors like colony growth did not all follow the same pattern. This study indicates that temperate corals may be allocating different nutritional sources to different metabolic or physiological needs.&#x20;

For bleached and unbleached corals along a depth gradient, the authors investigated the size and assemblage of zooplankton feeding, and the contribution of heterotrophy to the energy budget. They found that responses were very species specific but that heterotrophy contributed enough to view corals on a continuum from auto- to heterotrophic.&#x20;
