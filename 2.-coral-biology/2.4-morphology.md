# 2.4 Morphology

## Macromorpholoy

Macromorphology is here defined as the shape of the entire colony which can express inter- or intraspecific (polymorphic) variation.&#x20;

* corallite - the entire structure of the coral skeleton&#x20;
* calice - cup in coral skeleton&#x20;
* Septa - wall-like structures that radiate from the sides of each corallite&#x20;
* Columella - extends upward from the floor of the calice
* Basal plate - partition that provides new elevated bottom in the corallite when coral polyps grow by withdrawing itself upward and secreting a new basal plate

Shallow corals grow more slowly. Colonies go from massive - platylike along a depth gradient. Denser skeleton at depth.&#x20;

No change in calice morphology along a light gradient in Porites sp.&#x20;

Calcification rate was significantly higher in light environments. Top/end of branches & colonies grow faster. Detailed description of calcium carbonate reactions&#x20;
