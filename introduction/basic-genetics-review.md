# 1.2 Basic Genetics Review

#### Genetics methods

* Mendelian Traits - mono & dihybrid crosses
* Non-Mendelian Traits
  * Incomplete dominance - traits have an in between genotype&#x20;
  * Sex-linked traits - alelles on sex chromosomes&#x20;
* Pedigrees - trait of interest can be tracked&#x20;

[Epigenetics](https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/disease/epigenetics.htm) - the study of how behaviors and the environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work. Epigenetic changes are reversible and do not affect DNA sequence, but they can change how your body reads a DNA sequence.&#x20;

[Genotyping ](https://www.idtdna.com/pages/applications/genotyping)- The experimental procedure that identifies the differences in DNA sequence among individuals or populations. Used to understand connections between genotype and phenotype.&#x20;

[Transcriptomics](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Transcriptome-Fact-Sheet) - study of the transcriptome (complete set of RNA) to determine when and where genes are turned on or off&#x20;

[Gene expression](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Gene-Expression) -  the process by which information encoded in a gene is turned into a function primarily through transcription&#x20;

[Bioinformatics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1122955/) - application of tools of computation and analysis to capture interpretation of biological data&#x20;
