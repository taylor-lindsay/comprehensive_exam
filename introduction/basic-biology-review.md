# Basic Biology Review

## Amino Acids & Proteins

### AA structure&#x20;

* Central carbon surrounded by an amino group (H2N), a Carboxylic acid group (O=C-OH), an H, and a unique side chain&#x20;
* r -group
* Methyl groups&#x20;

### AA Types&#x20;

* Humans use about 20 AAs&#x20;
* Essential, conditionally essential, Nonessential

### Steps of Protein synthesis&#x20;

* Transcription - genes are copied into mRNA
  * mRNA built by RNA polymerase &#x20;
  * mRNA leaves nucleus and goes to ribosome&#x20;
* Translation - mRNA turned into a protein&#x20;
  * each codon of three bases codes for a specific AA
  * tRNA caries an amino acid and matches the anti-codon of three bases with the mRNA&#x20;
  * Peptide bonds - bind AAs together to form proteins&#x20;
  * ribosome moves along the mRNA until a complete chain of AAs is formed
  * chain of AAs folds up to form protein

## Cellular Respiration (Aerobic)

#### Glycolysis

* glucose is converted into pyruvate&#x20;
* Net yield +2 ATP&#x20;
* pyruvate converted to acetyl CoA&#x20;

#### Krebs Cycle / Citric acid&#x20;

* CO2 & +2ATP&#x20;
* Acetyl CoA broken down further into citric acid
* Citric acid is oxidized and energy is used to bind ADP and phosphate to make ATP and electron carriers (NADH & FADH2)

#### Electron Transport Chain&#x20;

* electrons used to create proton gradient to pump protons across membrane&#x20;
* Chemiosmosis - ATP synthase enzyme creates ATP&#x20;
* \+34 ATP&#x20;



* Proteolysis - the process by which proteins are broken down by HCL, pepsin & other digestive enzymes&#x20;
