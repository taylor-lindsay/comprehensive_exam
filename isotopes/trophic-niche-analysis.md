# 4.3 Trophic Niche Analysis

## Trophic position

* 1 base - <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-05-12 at 11.34.08 AM.png" alt="" data-size="line">
* Assumptions:&#x20;
  * Consumers acquire N from one source&#x20;
  * δ15Nbase captures full variation in δ15N
  * Consumer is at steady state with the diet&#x20;
  * lambda is valid for the δ15Nbase&#x20;
  * ∆15N is valid for the system&#x20;
* Mass balance mixing models:&#x20;
  * need δ values for consumer,  all diet sources, and the trophic fractionation ∆ between diet & consumer&#x20;
* Trophic discrimination factors (TDF)&#x20;
  * source mixing polygon has to overlap all the consumer values, otherwise you've missed a source.&#x20;
  * for every additional source, you need an additional isotope&#x20;
* Bayseian mixing models & R packages&#x20;
* Best practices for building a mixing model
