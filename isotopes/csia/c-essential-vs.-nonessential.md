# C: Essential vs. Nonessential

Essential amino acids (EAAs)

* Can not be synthesized by most metazoans, so they must come from the diet
* there is very low fractionation of EAAs between trophic positions&#x20;
* The âˆ†C of EAAs will reflect the base source of C (e.g. zooplankton, algae, etc.)&#x20;
*

Nonessential amino acids (NAAs)&#x20;

* can be synthesized by metazoans by breaking up other AAs and restructuring them&#x20;
*
