## Bulk Stable Isotope Analysis&#x20;

* used for bulk isotope values

1. Entire sample is homogenized & freeze dried
2. Tin capsules containing the sample are fed into an **elemental analyzer**&#x20;
   1. Samples are combusted&#x20;
   2. Gas Chromatography separates heavier from lighter elements&#x20;
3. The flow of gasses is fed into the mass spectrometer where they are pushed around a large magnet, separating&#x20;
4. Results show peaks for each element&#x20;

## Compound Specific Stable Isotope Analysis&#x20;

1. Initial processing (lipid extraction)&#x20;
2. Samples are homogenized & freeze dried & fed into **gas chromatograph combustion**.&#x20;
   1. Gas Chromatography separates compounds&#x20;
   2. Combustion breaks down compounds&#x20;
3. The flow of gasses is fed into the mass spectrometer where they are pushed around a large magnet, separating&#x20;
4. Results show peaks for each compound
5. Repeat steps 3-6 for each element&#x20;

Resulting peaks will be separated by AA. </p></figcaption></figure>

## Mass Spectrometry&#x20;

* inlet - either used gas chromatography or elemental analyzer to send in a specific flow of gasses in&#x20;
* samples ionized&#x20;
* electromagnet bends the path of the ions, sending them to a specific cup based on which isotopes you're measuring&#x20;
* Ions individually counted
* resluts show peaks for each isotope&#x20;
