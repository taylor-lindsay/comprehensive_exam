# Instrumentation & methodology

Elemental Analyzer

* used for bulk isotope values&#x20;

Gas Chromatography&#x20;

* Samples must go through lipid removal & acid hydrolysis first&#x20;

Resulting peaks will be seperated by AA. </p></figcaption></figure>

Mass Spectrometer&#x20;

* inlet - either used gas chromatography or elemental analyzer to send in a specific flow of gasses in&#x20;
* samples ionized&#x20;
* electromagnet bends the path of the ions, sending them to a specific cup based on which isotopes you're measuring&#x20;
* Ions individually counted
* resluts show peaks for each isotope&#x20;
