# 4.1d Organismal Isotopes

## Baseline (11)

_What was the animal eating?_&#x20;

* Autotroph baseline values affected by&#x20;
  * **Source of inorganic carbon**&#x20;
    * Marine DIC \~ 2 δ13C&#x20;
    * Atmospheric CO2 \~ -7 δ13C&#x20;
  * **photosynthetic pathways**&#x20;
    * Photosynthesis prefers 12C because it will diffuse quicker and react quicker&#x20;
    * C3 plants and marine phytoplankton have similar fractionation&#x20;
    * Macroagae & seagrasses use C3 but because of their DIC source, they have δ13C values closer to C4&#x20;
    * C3 plants - fractionation about 20‰  lower than source C
    * C4 plants - fractionation about 6‰ lower than source C &#x20;
      * Bundle sheath cell makes the process much more efficient&#x20;

Uses&#x20;

* **Generalists vs. specialists** - generalists may change between C3 and C4 sources depending on availability & season, while specialists only eat certain plants that are all C3 or C4&#x20;
* **Habitat use** - ex. phytoplankton have lower δ13C than benthic algae, so you can use this to assess inshore (benthic) vs offshore (plankton) feeding&#x20;
* [Trophic position ](../csia/n-trophic-vs.-source.md)

## Isotopic Incorporation (11)

_When was the food consumed?_&#x20;

* Changes in diet take time to be reflected in tissues
* Different tissues have different turnover times&#x20;
  * Metabolically Active
    * breath > Plasma, liver > Muscle, Red blood cells > Bone Collagen&#x20;
  * Metabolically Inert
    * (short timeframe) Fur, feathers, egg shell, fingernails, breastmilk&#x20;
    * (Accretionary) Teeth, hair, whiskers, baleen, otoliths&#x20;

## Physiology  (12)

_How did the animal incorporate the food?_&#x20;

Trophic fractionation&#x20;

* Commonly generalized but there are large amounts of variation in these numbers:&#x20;
* ∆13C +0.4 ‰ per trophic level&#x20;
* ∆15N +3.4 ‰ per trophic level   &#x20;

N - Protein Cycling&#x20;

* High dietary protein - convert protein to fat/glucose, high N excretion rates
* Low dietary protein - essential AA deficiency, use carbs & lipids for non-essential AA synthesis, low N excretion rates&#x20;
* Amino Acids&#x20;
  * The amino acid pool is comprised of protein already in the body, protein from the diet, and the synthesis of new amino acids from synthesis from the diet.&#x20;
  * AA go into body protein, N compounds (enzymes?), and waste products
  * Transamination - transfer of an amino group from one molecule to another, especially from an amino acid to a keto acid.&#x20;
    * diet/body protein transformed into alpha-keto acids&#x20;
  * Deamination - removal of an amino group from an amino acid or other compound

* **Quality of diet**&#x20;
  * &#x20;a high-quality diet suggests that the AA composition of diet matches consumer so  less fractionation will occur&#x20;
  * herbivore - lower protein content, lower excretion rate, lower ∆15N
  * Carnivore - higher protein, higher excretion, higher TDF&#x20;
* **Mode of excretion**&#x20;
  * ∆15N highest in Urea producers (mammals) > Uric acid (insects) > Ammonia (fish) > Guanine (arachnids) > Amino acids (babies)
  * Urea excretion is complex in mammals, lots of opportunity for fractionation&#x20;
* **Nutritional Status**&#x20;
  * starving animal starts to catabolize its own endogenous protein stores&#x20;
  * Catabolism - the breakdown of body molecules to form simpler ones&#x20;
  * as animal loses weight its ∆15N decreases

The Omnivore's Dilemma&#x20;

* Perfect Mixing - 50/50 split&#x20;
* Perfect routing - 100% from one source&#x20;
