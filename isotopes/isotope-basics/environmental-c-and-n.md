# 4.1c Environmental C and N

Carbon

* global δC in phytoplankton shows strong relationship to upwelling and latitude&#x20;
* surface ocean has equilibrium fractionation with the air (DIC)
* Photosynthesis preferentially takes up 12CO2 making residual CO2 more 13C enriched&#x20;
* Respiration preferentially releases 12CO2 so water DIC has lower 13C values&#x20;
* The biologial pump controls vertical 13C DIC gradient, with more 13C in surface where photosynthesis occurs, and less in pycnocline where respiration is more common&#x20;
* Upwelling brings low 13C DIC to surface at equator and continental boundaries&#x20;
* Seuss Effect: as CO2 concentrations have increased, δ13C has decreased drastically in the atmosphere due to burning of fossil fuels. These fossil fules are primarily preserved 12C.&#x20;

Nitrogen&#x20;

* There's a general relationship between DIN and phosphate in the ocean: N\* = (N-16\*P)
* δ15N increases with depth in ocean &#x20;
* Denitrification drives really high δ15N values in areas of very high productivity&#x20;
* N can be used as a land use tracer (manure, sewage, fertilizer) &#x20;
