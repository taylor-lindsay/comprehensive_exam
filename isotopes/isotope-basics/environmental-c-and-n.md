# Environmental C and N

Carbon

* global delta C in phytoplankton shows strong relationship to upwelling and latitude&#x20;
* surface ocean has equilibrium fractionation with the air (DIC)
* Photosynthesis preferentially takes up 12CO2 making residual CO2 more 13C enriched&#x20;
* Respiration preferentially releases 12CO2 so water DIC has lower 13C values&#x20;
* The biologial pump controls vertical 13C DIC gradient, with more 13C in surface where photosynthesis occurs, and less in pycnocline where respiration is more common&#x20;
* Upwelling brings low 13C DIC to surface at equator and continental boundaries&#x20;
* Seuss Effect:&#x20;
