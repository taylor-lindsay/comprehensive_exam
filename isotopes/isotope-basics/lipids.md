# 🧀 Lipids

* ∆13C decreases with increasing dietary lipid content&#x20;
* Lipids have low δ13C values relative to protein
* Thus variation in tissue δ13C can be driven by variation in % lipid.
* Lipids typically don't have N&#x20;

Lipid extraction:&#x20;

* chemical solvents extract lipids from tissue&#x20;
* can bias δ15N values&#x20;
* Mathematical corrections can also be used in lieu of lipid extraction&#x20;

Types:

* Fatty acids - Unsaturated & saturated
* Cholesterol
* Wax esters&#x20;

Lipid C routing into NAAs&#x20;

* differential fractionation of the different NAAs because they are created at different points in the citric acid cycle.&#x20;
