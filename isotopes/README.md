# Isotope Basics

## Definitions&#x20;

**Isotope** - atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons, differ in mass but have essentialy the same chemical reactivity&#x20;

* **Stable** - do not undergo radioactive decay, but do undergo fractionation&#x20;
* **Radioactive** - unstable isotopes that will decay to other elements by shedding their neutrons / protons to achieve stability&#x20;

**Fractionation** - the alteration of the distribution of stable isotopes as a result of chemical, physical, or biological processes

* **Kinetic** - Unidirectional reactions due to differences in reaction rate of molecules or atoms containing different masses - light isotope usually reacts faster - includes transport or diffusion processes dealing with flux&#x20;
  * sometimes there are multiple products, which still have to conserve mass&#x20;
* **Equilibrium** - Isotope exchange reactions driven by changes in vibrational energies of molecules, forward and back reactions reach thermodynamic equilibrium - the heavy isotope accumulates where it is held strongest - phase changes
  * alpha (fractionation rate) decrease with temp&#x20;
  * fractionation highest for light elements&#x20;
*   Rayleigh fractionation - products are isolated from reactants immediately after formation, leading to characteristic isotope pattern of evolving phases

* **Conservation of mass** - reactant and product must preserve original epsilon when 100% reacted&#x20;

**Most important Isotopes (for me)** - O and H are typically associated with environmental fractionation and gradients, while N and C are more important for biological processes&#x20;

* 1H vs 2H
* 12C vs 13C
* 14N vs 15N
* 16O vs 18O

### Notation

* **Delta Notation** - Allows us to compare between samples by standardizing them to international standards. <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-03-29 at 5.08.43 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line"> where R is the heavy/light isotope ratio, units are permil â€°.&#x20;
  * positive values = enrichment&#x20;
  * negative values = depletion&#x20;
* **Big Delta Notation** - Isotope separation <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-03-29 at 5.17.12 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line">
* **Epsilon** - Isotope Enrichment <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-03-29 at 5.19.19 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line">
* **Alpha notation** - Isotope Fractionation <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-03-29 at 5.16.24 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line">
  * very temperature dependent&#x20;
* Turnover time - T&#x20;
