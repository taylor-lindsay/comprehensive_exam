# 4.4 CSIA

#### What is the difference between CSIA & SIA and how does CSIA work?&#x20;

Compound specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) elevates traditional bulk stable isotope analysis (SIA) by analyzing isotope ratios of multiple compounds.&#x20;

Bulk SIA&#x20;

1. Entire sample is homogenized & freeze dried
2. Tin capsules containing the sample are fed into an elemental analyzer&#x20;
   1. Samples are combusted&#x20;
   2. Gas Chromatography separates heavier from lighter elements&#x20;
3. The flow of gasses is fed into the mass spectrometer where they are pushed around a large magnet, separating&#x20;
4. Results show peaks for each element&#x20;

CSIA

1. Initial processing (lipid extraction)&#x20;
2. Samples are homogenized & freeze dried & fed into gas chromatograph combustion.&#x20;
3. Gas Chromatography separates compounds&#x20;
4. Combustion breaks down compounds&#x20;
5. The flow of gasses is fed into the mass spectrometer where they are pushed around a large magnet, separating&#x20;
6. Results show peaks for each compound
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each element&#x20;

#### Why use CSIA on corals

* As mixotrophs, it is difficult to disentangle the energetic inputs&#x20;

## <mark style="background-color:orange;">Examples of CSIA on corals</mark>&#x20;

#### Fox et al. 2019

Ran CSIA for C only on corals around an island. Patterns of δ13C values of individual AAs provided separation of autotrophic & heterotrophic nutritional inputs. Traditional bulk measurements were a good proxy for heterotrophy vs autotrophy.  No spacial patterns found.&#x20;

#### Wall et al. 2021

Ran CISA for N and C on corals under light & feeding conditions. Had very small sample sizes so very few results were significant.&#x20;

#### Lesser, Slattery & Macartney 2022

Rebuttal to the criticism against using stable isotopes to analyze the transition from autotrophy to heterotrophy. Re-analysis of SIA and CSIA from previous data sets along a depth gradient. AAs valine and isoleucine showed a significant effect of depth, with shallow corals having less negative 13C values than their mesophotic counterparts. CSIA on for trophic position on glu and phe identified differences between host and sym but not along depth gradients.&#x20;

## Examples of CSIA on other mixotrophs&#x20;

#### Macartney, Slattery & Lesser 2021&#x20;

CSIA on mixotrophic sponges. Used ΣV value which measures the bacterial resynthesis & translocation of organic matter. More focus on microbes than symbionts. No significant change in C but yes in N based on particulate availability across depth gradients & changes in trophic level.&#x20;

## CSIA on non-mixotrophs

#### Larsen, Hansen & Dierking 2020

Conducted CSIA on fish to determine feeding differences in marine habitats. Found significant differences between six functional groups of fish and some species exhibited site dependent values.&#x20;

#### McMahon et al. 2016&#x20;

CSIA on 7 reef fishes with four C source end members including coral. Determined that CSIA was effective at predicting the C source of the fishes, which often followed expected sources, but often showed that in oceanic sites, there was a shift to plantonic sources.&#x20;
