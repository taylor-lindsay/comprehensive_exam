## Competition

## Niche Partitioning&#x20;

#### Assembly Rules

* [processes in nature that my help explain the existence of vegetation in various ecosystems](https://greatecology.com/2013/10/04/ecological-assembly-rules/)
* historical patterns of speciation, migration, dispersal, abiotic environmental factors, biotic interactions&#x20;
* The enemy of my enemy is my friend - trophic cascade&#x20;
* Timing is the key to success - species that arrive first often survive because they have space and nutrient access&#x20;
* Access Denied - when a species goes extinct in a system, it is often unable to re-invade successfully &#x20;
* predator cannot invade a new community without prey&#x20;
* 1 forbidden species combinations - competition not random immigration drives species competition on islands
* 2 reduced niche overlap - species occurring on islands together should be more specialized and therefore have less niche overlap&#x20;

#### Island Biogeography&#x20;

* Island diversity - determined by rate of new species arrival and extinction rate (these have inverse relationships, so the predicted number of species is where they overlap)&#x20;
* Island Size Effect - larger islands can have more species because they have higher immigration and lower extinction &#x20;
* Islands are geographically isolated, animals with high dispersal capability are more likely on islands&#x20;
* Low predation & competition
* speciation & extinction happen faster on islands&#x20;
* This theory can apply to habitat fragmentation -> conservation&#x20;

## Neutral Theory & Niche-based alternatives & Null Models&#x20;

#### Intermediate disturbance hypothesis

* low disturbance allows the dominant species can exclude competitors to completely take over&#x20;
* high disturbance kills everything&#x20;
* medium/intermediate allows for new species to establish&#x20;
