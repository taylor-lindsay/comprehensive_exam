# 3.2 General Ecology

## Competition

* Competition over resources like food, space&#x20;
* Intraspecific - competition for mates, food, light, water, space&#x20;
* Interspecific - food, light, water, space&#x20;
* On the Reef - Competition for space is huge
  * intraspecific - two corals fight for space or out-shade each other&#x20;
  * Interspecific - algae vs. coral for space, light, nutrients&#x20;
* competitive exclusion principle - two species which compete for the same limited resources, one species out-competes the other&#x20;

## Niche Partitioning

* Ecological niche - the sum of all resources both biotic and abiotic that an organism uses in its lifetime&#x20;
  * prevents direct competition for a reosurce&#x20;
* Fundamental niche - the ideal niche an organism could optimally have&#x20;
* Realized niche - the real niche that isn't optimal&#x20;
* Resource Partitioning - when similar species settle into different niches that allow them to coexist&#x20;
  * ex. [MacArthur's warblers](https://web.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/MacArthur's\_Warblers.html) thought to have identical niches actually varied slightly to use different parts of the tree and mated at different times of the year so that their maximum nutritional periods didn't overlap&#x20;
* Character displacement - when similar species overlap geographically, the things that make them different (niche differentiation) is exacerbated in the overlapping area, but the differences are lost when the species don't overlap
  * ex. Grant's finches&#x20;

## Succession  & Ecosystem Assembly

#### Succession&#x20;

* Disturbances - very common, various scales
* Primary succession - when life occupies a landscape for the first time. No competition&#x20;
  * build or re-build soils
* Pioneer species -&#x20;
* Secondary succession - common after a small disturbance, caused by a change in a microclimate that allow different species to come in and fill the niche&#x20;
* Climax community - idealized community that will result after series of succession has stabilized. more theoretical than practical because there is constant change in nature&#x20;
  * higher succession level indicated by high biodiversity&#x20;
* Stochasticity - element of unpredictable variability&#x20;

#### Assembly Rules

* [processes in nature that my help explain the existence of vegetation in various ecosystems](https://greatecology.com/2013/10/04/ecological-assembly-rules/)
* historical patterns of speciation, migration, dispersal, abiotic environmental factors, biotic interactions&#x20;
* The enemy of my enemy is my friend - trophic cascade&#x20;
* Timing is the key to success - species that arrive first often survive because they have space and nutrient access&#x20;
* Access Denied - when a species goes extinct in a system, it is often unable to re-invade successfully &#x20;
* predator cannot invade a new community without prey&#x20;
* 1 forbidden species combinations - competition not random immigration drives species competition on islands
* 2 reduced niche overlap - species occurring on islands together should be more specialized and therefore have less niche overlap&#x20;

#### Island Biogeography&#x20;

* Island diversity - determined by rate of new species arrival and extinction rate (these have inverse relationships, so the predicted number of species is where they overlap)&#x20;
* Island Size Effect - larger islands can have more species because they have higher immigration and lower extinction &#x20;
* Islands are geographically isolated, animals with high dispersal capability are more likely on islands&#x20;
* Low predation & competition
* speciation & extinction happen faster on islands&#x20;
* This theory can apply to habitat fragmentation -> conservation&#x20;

## Neutral Theory & Niche-based alternatives & Null Models&#x20;

#### Intermediate disturbance hypothesis

* low disturbance allows the dominant species can exclude competitors to completely take over&#x20;
* high disturbance kills everything&#x20;
* medium/intermediate open new niches and allows for new species to establish&#x20;
