# Physiology

&#x20;Physiology in general and coral physiology   Since your thesis relates largely to this, you should be proficient in concepts related to the measurement and description of physiological variation. You should know the main articles related to physiological changes, especially about isotopic variation. You should also know a fair bit about light, calice, and coral morphology, how that interaction alters energy production in a coral, and how all that together may vary in different reef habitats such as a shallow back reef environment or a dynamic deep water fore reef habitat.
