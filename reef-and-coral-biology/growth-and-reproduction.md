# Growth & Reproduction

## Process of Reef Growth&#x20;

Asexual budding?&#x20;

* Growth is affected by light intensity, water motion, depth, turbidity, day length, water temp, plankton concentration, predation, competition&#x20;

Skeletal growth&#x20;

* growth rate determined by skeleton density&#x20;
* Average growth 1mm upward and 8mm horizontally per year (marine life book)
* depends on balance of deposition and removal of CaCO3&#x20;
  * contributions form calcareous algae, colonial hydrozoans, skeletons of crustaceans, bryozoans, foraminifera, mollusks, echinoderms.&#x20;
  * loss of CaCO3 can be caused by grazing/scraping urchins & fish, or etchers (bacteria, fungi, algae) that penetrate skeletons. Infaunal organisms (sponges, bivalves, worms) bore holes into skeletons.&#x20;
