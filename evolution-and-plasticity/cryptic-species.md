# Cryptic Species

Do cryptic species occupy the same habitats? Are they spatially variable? Are they always segregated across depths? How is variation across depths compared with across-shelf locations (onshore/offshore)? Are they often locally adapted? Are they morphologically different? Does it matter for the habitats they occupy? Describe both micromorphology and macromorphology examples of cryptics segregated across habitats. Are they physiologically differentiated? What is the evidence? What is the level of plasticity? Do they associate with different symbionts? Different microbiota? Is there evidence of heat-stress variation? Variation in pH sensitivity? Oxygen?
