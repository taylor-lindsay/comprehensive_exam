# 3.1 Evolution & Plasticity

## Mechanisms of Evolution

Gene flow - transfer of genetic material from one population to another.&#x20;

* High gene flow will result in the same allele frequencies&#x20;

Genetic Drift - Random removal of individuals that changes allele frequencies&#x20;

* bottleneck effect - random individuals survive but their new ratios change the local population&#x20;
* Founder effect - new organisms that arrive do not always represent former population&#x20;

Mutation - random change in nucleic acid&#x20;

* gene mutations - change in one or more base (substitution/insertion/deletion), may cause different AAs&#x20;
* Chromosomal mutations - duplication, deletion, inversion, translocation of information on chromosomes&#x20;
* If mutation is heritable, it can affect evolution&#x20;

Natural Selection - organisms that are more adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and pass on the genes that aided in their success.&#x20;

## Evolution Definitions

Speciation -  reproductive isolation leads to independent species&#x20;

* Allopatric speciation - geographical barrier that prevents interbreeding. Over time, the populations change causing speciation
* Sympatric speciation - speciation that occurs in the same habitat&#x20;
  * Prezygotic barriers - behavioral isolation, temporal isolation, habitat isolation&#x20;
  * Postzygotic barriers - mating ocurred but offspring is weak, unable to develop, or infertile&#x20;

Species - must be able to reproduce&#x20;

Adaptation - shift in allele frequency in a population over multiple generations&#x20;

* optimal trait for that environment must be selected for&#x20;

Acclimation - when an organism undergoes physiological, morphological or biochemical change within its lifetime, to enhance survival&#x20;

Fitness - reproductive potential&#x20;

Plasticity

Specialization&#x20;

#### Theories & Effects

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

* determines stable-state genotype ratios&#x20;
* No mechanisms of evolution are at play&#x20;
* serves as a baseline for genetics&#x20;

Neutral theory of Molecular evolution&#x20;

* Historical theory of selectionism
  * Detrimental mutation -> negative selection -> mutation not seen
  * Beneficial mutation -> positive selection -> Mutation seen&#x20;
  * Classical school of thought - assume that there is a single predominant most fit gene, and that if a new gene is more beneficial it will be quickly fixed by natural selection&#x20;
  * Balance school of thought - appreciate amount of polymorphism in gene pool, maintained actively by natural selection&#x20;
* when we started doing molecular work, we saw that polymorphism was way more common than expected
* neutral mutation -> no selection (no fitness change) -> mutation may be seen (genetic drift, stochastic)&#x20;

#### Molecular clock

* neutral mutations accumulate at a constant rate over time&#x20;
