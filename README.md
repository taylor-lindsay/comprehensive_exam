### About Me & My Research&#x20;

I am completing a PhD in Biological and Environmental Sciences with a focus in Evolution and Marine Biology at the University of Rhode Island. My work is focused on the effects of light on coral physiology and morphology. I am also integrating stable isotope analysis into my work to investigate the contributions of symbiotic autotrophy and heterotrophy in scleractinian corals.&#x20;
