# 3.3 Species

a group of living organisms of similar individuals capable of reproducing viable offspring

* "On the Origin of Species" 1859
* introduced natural selection as a gradual and continuous mechanism of change&#x20;
* "organisms in one or more populations that together form a cohesive, reproductive unit—a separate lineage on its own evolutionary trajectory"&#x20;

Population Genetics aka The Modern Synthesis &#x20;

* Mathematical pop gen models identified the genetic mechanisms of evolutionary change&#x20;
* 1930s - Fisher, Haldane, Wright, Dobzhansky & more&#x20;

Biological species concept

* Mayr 1942
* New species formation involves reproductive barriers (pre or post zygotic)&#x20;
* speciation occurs when mating is no longer viable&#x20;
* almost entirely required geographic isolation&#x20;

1990s Reclassification&#x20;

* Reclassification of modes of speciation to focus on the processes driving genetic divergence over geographical divergence

Genetics/genomics

* studies of a whole genome&#x20;
* genomic islands of divergence where a region of genes (single nucleotide to whole chromosome) that exhibits more genetic differentiation than observed randomly&#x20;

a group of living organisms of similar individuals capable of reproducing viable offspring

Species ID

* in practical modern situations, we rely almost entirely on morphology, geography, and behavior to identify species.&#x20;
* behavior - birds&#x20;

#### How would you determine the total number of species on earth?&#x20;

* estimates = 8.7 billion [Paper 1](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127)&#x20;
* often overlook microbes, bacteria, etc
* Estimate with microbes = 1 trillion [Paper 2](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160502161058.htm)
