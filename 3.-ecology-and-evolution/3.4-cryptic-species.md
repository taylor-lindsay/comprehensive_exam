# 3.4 Cryptic Species

#### What is a Cryptic Species?&#x20;

* two or more morphologically indistinguishable biological groups that are incapable of interbreeding  ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cryptic%20species))&#x20;
* A species which looks very similar to another, but which is reproductively isolated from it ([Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/cryptic-species))
* more and more being discovered with molecular work&#x20;

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">Do cryptic species occupy the same habitats? Are they spatially variable? Are they always segregated across depths? How is variation across depths compared with across-shelf locations (onshore/offshore)?</mark>&#x20;

*

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">Are they often locally adapted? What is the level of plasticity?</mark>

*

#### Are they morphologically different? <mark style="background-color:orange;">Describe both micromorphology and macromorphology examples of cryptics segregated across habitats.</mark>

* Typically, cryptic species are not morphologically different, or their morphological range overlaps, making them indistinguishable.&#x20;

#### Are they physiologically differentiated? <mark style="background-color:orange;">What is the evidence?</mark>&#x20;

* As independent species, they should exhibit physiological differences associated with their life history.&#x20;
* reproductive isolation in different habitats would result in natural selection or other processes of evolution that would result in the fixation of traits (SNPs). While these traits may not be visible to the human eye, it is likely that there are non-visible traits that are different&#x20;
* ex. heat stress acclimation&#x20;

#### &#x20;<mark style="background-color:orange;">Do they associate with different symbionts? Different microbiota?</mark>&#x20;

*

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">Is there evidence of heat-stress variation? Variation in pH sensitivity? Oxygen?</mark>
