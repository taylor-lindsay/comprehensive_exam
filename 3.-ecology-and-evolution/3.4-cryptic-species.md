# 3.4 Cryptic Species

#### What is a Cryptic Species?&#x20;

* two or more morphologically indistinguishable biological groups that are incapable of interbreeding  ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cryptic%20species))&#x20;
* A species which looks very similar to another, but which is reproductively isolated from it ([Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/cryptic-species))
* more and more being discovered with molecular work&#x20;

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">Do cryptic species occupy the same habitats? Are they spatially variable? Are they always segregated across depths? How is variation across depths compared with across-shelf locations (onshore/offshore)?</mark>&#x20;

*

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">Are they often locally adapted? What is the level of plasticity?</mark>

*

#### Are they morphologically different? <mark style="background-color:orange;">Describe both micromorphology and macromorphology examples of cryptics segregated across habitats.</mark>

* Typically, cryptic species are not morphologically different, or their morphological range overlaps, making them indistinguishable.&#x20;

#### Are they physiologically differentiated? <mark style="background-color:orange;">What is the evidence?</mark>&#x20;

* As independent species, they should exhibit physiological differences associated with their life history.&#x20;
* reproductive isolation in different habitats would result in natural selection or other processes of evolution that would result in the fixation of traits (SNPs). While these traits may not be visible to the human eye, it is likely that there are non-visible traits that are different&#x20;
* ex. heat stress acclimation&#x20;

#### &#x20;<mark style="background-color:orange;">Do they associate with different symbionts? Different microbiota?</mark>&#x20;

*

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">Is there evidence of heat-stress variation? Variation in pH sensitivity? Oxygen?</mark>

Reproductive isolation in an octocoral species led to depth-segregated cryptic lineages. The lineages changed more along depth gradients than geographically,  across the Caribbean basin. &#x20;

The authors conducted reciprocal transplants on OFRA and OANN in panama and measured changes in symbiont type through ITS2 and microbiome. They found that microbiome is affected by depth but not by species and symbiont community is affected by species by not depth. They did not test the scleractinian for cryptic lineages. &#x20;

The authors investigated the population structure of Acropora pruinosa in Japan, finding two cryptic populations segregated by geography. There was very low genetic diversity within each population, and very low connectivity between them.&#x20;

Reanalyzed previous data to reveal that OFAV exhibited multiple cryptic lineages. There was no trend in environment nor symbiont type with the lineages. Emphasizes the importance of understanding cryptic diversity for understanding other patterns in morphology & physiology, accurately quantifying population sizes and genetic diversity.&#x20;

The authors evaluated the genetic diversity of a coral species and its symbionts in three sites along a depth gradient. They found genetic partitioning of both coral host & symbiont across depths, but not sampling location. There was codiversification of the symbiont and host to specific environments.&#x20;
